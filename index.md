I am a third year Computer Science PhD student studying data systems at Stanford University, advised by [Peter Bailis](http://www.bailis.org/).
I am broadly interested in developing efficient and usable statistical tools for large data streams, bridging the gap between machine learning and user-facing analytics. 
My recent projects involve fast unsupervised classification and quantile estimation algorithms as part of the [Macrobase](http://macrobase.stanford.edu/) data exploration system.

Prior to Stanford, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Harvard, working with [Greg Morrisett](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jgm/) on type systems for safe programming, and spent two years at Facebook in Data Infra and Ads Targeting. My [Industry Resume](/assets/resumeWeb.pdf).
