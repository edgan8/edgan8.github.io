I am a fourth year Computer Science PhD student doing systems and machine learning research at Stanford University, advised by [Peter Bailis](http://www.bailis.org/).
I am broadly interested in developing tools for scalable machine learning while preserving reliability guarantees.
My recent projects include algorithms for nonparametric outlier classification and percentile estimation.

Prior to Stanford, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Harvard, working with [Greg Morrisett](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jgm/) on type systems for safe programming, and spent two years at Facebook in Data Infrastructure and Ads Targeting. [Resume](/assets/resumeWeb.pdf).
