I am a fifth year Computer Science PhD at Stanford University, advised by [Peter Bailis](http://www.bailis.org/).
I am interested in scalable algorithms for data analytics and machine learning, with a focus on data summarization algorithms.
Recent projects include work on quantile and heavy-hitters sketches, kernel density estimation, and domain adaptation.

I am graduating Spring 2020 with a PhD thesis on [Data summaries for scalable, high-cardinality analytics](https://purl.stanford.edu/hv931ph6832)
and will be joining Databricks as a software engineer in Summer 2020.

Prior to Stanford, I studied at Harvard, 
working with [Greg Morrisett](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jgm/) on programming language type systems, 
and spent two years at Facebook in Data Infrastructure and Ads Targeting. [Resume](/assets/resumeWeb.pdf).
