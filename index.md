I am a fifth year Computer Science PhD at Stanford University, advised by [Peter Bailis](http://www.bailis.org/).
My research is in scalable algorithms for data analytics and machine learning, with a focus on summarization and approximation.
Recent projects include work on quantile and heavy-hitters sketches, kernel density estimation, and domain adaptation.

Prior to Stanford, I studied at Harvard, 
working with [Greg Morrisett](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jgm/) on programming language type systems, 
and spent two years at Facebook in Data Infrastructure and Ads Targeting. [Resume](/assets/resumeWeb.pdf).
