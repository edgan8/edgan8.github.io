I'm currently a software engineer at Scale AI working on model post-training and evals infra, 
including [Precog](https://scale.com/blog/precog) and the SEAL leaderboards. Previously at Waymo and Databricks. 

I graduated from Stanford with a PhD in Computer Science on [Data summaries for scalable, high-cardinality analytics](https://purl.stanford.edu/hv931ph6832) advised by Peter Bailis.
