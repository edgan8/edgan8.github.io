I am a software engineer at Waymo working on agent model evaluation -- measuring prediction accuracy for vehicle and pedestrian trajectories. Previously I worked on ML workflow products at Databricks and completed a PhD at Stanford on [Data summaries for scalable, high-cardinality analytics](https://purl.stanford.edu/hv931ph6832) advised by [Peter Bailis](http://www.bailis.org/).
