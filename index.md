I am currently a Software Engineer at Databricks working on machine learning
infrastructure. 

I recently graduated with a PhD from Stanford on [Data summaries for scalable, high-cardinality analytics](https://purl.stanford.edu/hv931ph6832)
advised by [Peter Bailis](http://www.bailis.org/), and I am broadly interested in
scalable algorithms for data analytics and machine learning. [Resume](/assets/resumeWeb.pdf).
